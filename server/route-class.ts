/*
 * Route classification (DESIGN-0006 Component 1).
 *
 * One classifier shared by logs, metrics, and traces, so the three can
 * never disagree about what a request was, and so none of them can
 * independently blow up label cardinality.
 *
 * Both inputs here are attacker-controlled. SPA paths are unbounded —
 * `/donaldgifford/docz-site/design/DESIGN-0001` is a real one, and any
 * URL a browser requests would become a label value — and `fetch()`
 * accepts arbitrary method tokens. Everything this module returns is
 * therefore drawn from a closed set, never echoed from the request.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no globals, imports nothing from serve.ts. The proxy
 * constants live here rather than in serve.ts because this is the
 * module that has to reason about them exhaustively.
