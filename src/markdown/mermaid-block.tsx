/*
 * Client-side mermaid rendering (IMPL-0002 Phase 4, OQ-1a).
 *
 * MarkdownPre routes `pre[data-mermaid-source]` here; the marker only
 * ever fires for real ```mermaid fences (document HTML can't smuggle
 * the attribute past sanitize). The ~700 KB mermaid library loads via
 * dynamic import on first mount only — it must NEVER appear in the
 * eager graph (bundle budget) or even the markdown chunk.
 *
 * SECURITY — the ONE sanctioned innerHTML in this codebase: the SVG
 * string comes from mermaid.render(), never from document HTML.
 * TWO settings carry the guarantee, verified in e2e:
 *   - securityLevel "strict": click directives disabled, label HTML
 *     DOMPurify'd. Strict ALONE is not enough — purified-but-real
 *     elements (an <img src> tracking pixel) still land in
 *     foreignObject labels.
 *   - htmlLabels false (global + flowchart): labels render as SVG
 *     <text>, so hostile markup in a node label stays literal text —
 *     no element ever materializes from document text.
 * A THIRD setting keeps the second one true — see MERMAID_SECURE_KEYS.
 *
 * Both survive mermaid 12 unchanged: `securityLevel` keeps its four
 * levels, and the root `htmlLabels` now explicitly OUTRANKS every
 * per-diagram copy (`flowchart.htmlLabels` and friends are deprecated
 * in its favour), which makes one `false` cover diagram types this file
 * never names. The nested one stays set anyway — it costs a line and
 * the precedence rule is upstream's to change.
 *
 * Do not copy this pattern elsewhere and do not relax either setting;
 * keep the hostile-source rows in the XSS suite and e2e green when
 * touching this. (rfc-site's "strict doesn't render" note described
 * the `sandbox` iframe mode, not strict.)
 *
 * Lessons carried from rfc-site's hydrator: SVG cache keyed by source
 * (StrictMode double-mount flashes the source text otherwise) and the
 * MINIMAL documented themeVariables set — extra variables break
 * mermaid.render silently. Render failure keeps the source visible as
 * a plain code block; a blank box is never an outcome.

 * `secure` is the list of config keys a diagram's own YAML front matter

 * but NOT `htmlLabels`, and the gap is real rather than theoretical:
 * audited against the installed 11.16.0 and proven by test in
 * `mermaid-config.test.ts`, a hostile `config:` block otherwise flips
 * BOTH the global flag and the nested `flowchart.htmlLabels`,
 * re-opening the exact vector strict mode leaves open. Mermaid's
 * directive sanitizer recurses into nested config objects, so the ONE
 * top-level entry covers both paths. `secure` is itself always secure,
 * so a document cannot unset any of this.
 *
 * Upstream's own defaults are restated here rather than added to,
 * because mermaid currently UNIONS this array with its defaults and
 * that is an implementation detail — under clobber semantics a
 * one-element array would silently drop `securityLevel` from the
 * protected set. The EFFECTIVE list is what the test asserts on, and
 * it also fails if a future mermaid protects a key this list omits.

 * survives the merge.
 *
 * `nodeBorder` is load-bearing beyond its own color in v12. The `neo`
 * look strokes nodes with a gradient whenever the theme sets
 * `useGradient` — and `base` does. Theme.calculate turns it back off
 * precisely when the overrides carry `nodeBorder` and not
 * `useGradient`, which is this map. MERMAID_LOOK keeps us off `neo`
